# Afterten Orders

Standalone Android app for outlet ordering and supervisor approvals.

## Setup
1. Copy `gradle.properties` values as needed (Supabase URL/anon key).
2. Open this folder in Android Studio.
3. Run the `ordersDebug` variant on a device or emulator.

Stocktake/backoffice logic remains in the original app and is not used here.
