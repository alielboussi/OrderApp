Middleware service deploy (Windows)

1) Publish the service (required)
- On your build machine, publish the POS sync service:
  dotnet publish pos-sync-service\PosSyncService.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -o publish
- Copy EVERYTHING from the publish folder into Middleware\service
  (UltraAutomaticScreenSaver.exe + all DLLs + appsettings.json)
- Copy Middleware\appsettings.template.json into Middleware\service

2) Transfer to the outlet
- Copy the ENTIRE Middleware folder (with Middleware\service populated) to the outlet machine.

3) Install the service
Option A: Run the installer EXE (recommended)
- Build the installer once:
  cd Middleware\installer
  dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
- Copy the installer EXE output files into Middleware\service
- Run Middleware\service\InstallMiddleware.exe as Administrator

Option B: Use the PowerShell installer
- Ensure Middleware\service contains the published service files
- Run Middleware\install-service.bat as Administrator

4) Configure
- Edit %LOCALAPPDATA%\Ultra Automatic Screen Saver\appsettings.json
- Set Outlet:Id, Supabase Url/ServiceKey, and Sync:MinSaleDateUtc

5) Start service
- In Services, start Ultra Automatic Screen Saver

Notes
- The Middleware folder by itself is NOT enough; it must include the published service binaries.
- The tray UI uses the same config file in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Ultra Automatic Screen Saver.
- After changing Sync:MinSaleDateUtc, restart the service.
