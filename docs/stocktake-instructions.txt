Stocktake visibility rule (do not change):
- Ingredients and variants must be shown in the stocktake app even when stock_ledger has no rows.
- Stocktake lists must NOT rely on stock_ledger to display ingredients or variants.
- Base finished items should remain hidden in stocktake lists.
- Source of visibility should be catalog/outlet mapping (e.g., outlet_products / variants) not stock_ledger.
